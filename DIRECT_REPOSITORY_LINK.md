## ⚠️ If You Can't Find Them

The repository might not have these exact phrases. In that case:

### Option 1: Use Individual Words
Look for separate folders:
- "Good" (as its own sign)
- "Morning" (as its own sign)
- "Night" (as its own sign)
- "Evening" (as its own sign)

Then combine them in your code to play sequentially.

### Option 2: Check Alternative Names
The signs might be named:
- "GM" instead of "Good Morning"
- "GN" instead of "Good Night"
- "GE" instead of "Good Evening"

### Option 3: Use Similar Signs
- "Hello" for general greetings
- "Good" + "Morning" separately
- "Good" + "Night" separately
